Ishmael, the Cat

Background: Named after the thoughtful and introspective narrator of Moby Dick, Ishmael the cat is curious and contemplative.
Despite his literary name, he harbors no great love for adventures at sea or, indeed, whales.
Personality Traits: Observant, calm, occasionally aloof, Ishmael enjoys the quiet life, preferring sunny spots by the window to the vast ocean.


Ahab, the Dog
Background: Ahab takes his name from the obsessive captain in Melville's tale.
Unlike his namesake, this Ahab's greatest quest is for the next treat or belly rub rather than any whale.
Personality Traits: Energetic, loyal, and decidedly more social than Ishmael, Ahab often leads the charge during playtime, though he remains blissfully unaware of any whales.
